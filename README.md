# **Overview**

This is a responsive weather web application that allows users to search for cities and view real-time weather information. The app fetches data from the OpenWeather API through a Node.js + Express backend (used as a proxy to keep API keys secure). It also displays additional details such as humidity, wind speed, and sunrise/sunset times. Users can bookmark cities for quick access, and the app automatically adapts its background to day or night based on the locationâ€™s local time.
